    <h1>Hello, I'm Jarin Tasnim Noshin</h1>
    <h2>Professional digital marketer + AI-powered strategist</h2>
  </header>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h1>I'm a mission-driven marketing strategist and writer with over a decade of experience using data, storytelling, and technology to advance equity, education, and sustainability. I hold an MBA in Marketing Analytics from the Zicklin School of Business, where I focused on digital strategy, business consulting, and global economic systems.

Currently leading digital engagement at BlackRock, I specialize in AI-powered communications that connect diverse audiences through inclusive, research-informed narratives. My work spans launching impact campaigns at HSBC and Prime Bank, producing thought leadership at Morgan Stanley, and writing business columns as a Finance Correspondent at IBT Media.

In 2025, I served as a Virtual Delegate to the World Bank Youth Summit, contributing to global conversations on sustainability, digital transformation, and inclusive growth. I'm also a proud member of the Financial Women's Association, where I advocate for gender equity in the finance and technology sectors.

With certifications in Google Analytics 360 and IBM AI Essentials, I bring a unique blend of strategic insight, technical expertise, and editorial skills, well-suited for institutions committed to the public good, research, and education.
